# Voters_vote
What if instead of having volunteers that are spending hours a day counting votes manually, we have an app that was backed by blockchain, recording each vote made by a voter and ensuring double-voting is not possible.
Each transaction that is submitted to the ordering service, have a signature address and we can trace back each transaction to a registered voter of the application, in the case of an audit.
