# Voters_vote
What if instead of having volunteers that are spending hours a day counting votes manually, we have an app that was backed by blockchain, recording each vote made by a voter and ensuring double-voting is not possible.

**That is what this website exactly does**
### This Project is a web app in which the voters are given Unique address and can cast votes
Each transaction that is submitted to the ordering service, have a signature address and we can trace back each transaction to a registered voter of the application, in the case of an audit.

After that, users use their ethereum wallet account address to submit votes, during which the application checks to see if the user with this address has voted before. If this particular address has not been used before, the vote goes through the contract, and the vote count is updated.
